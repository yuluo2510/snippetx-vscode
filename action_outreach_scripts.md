# High-Conversion Outbound Scripts & Playbooks

## Script Framework by Trigger Event

### Script 1: Violation-Triggered Outreach
**Subject:** "Alternative to [Company]'s recent $125k MSRB compliance cost?"

**Email:**
"Hi [First Name],

I saw [Company]'s March 2025 settlement with MSRB regarding G-37 reporting delays - that $125k fine plus the 6-week investigation preparation looks painful.

I'm reaching out because we've helped 23 regional dealers (Stifel's size) eliminate manual compliance processes after similar violations.

The typical ROI: $400K+ in avoided penalties and 200+ hours of staff time rededicated to revenue generation.

Worth a 15-minute conversation about preventing the next violation cycle?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

**Phone Script Opening:**
"[Name], this is [Your Name] calling about [Company]'s recent MSRB settlement. Rather than the usual compliance software pitch, could I share how dealers like D.A. Davidson cut their quarterly G-40 prep time from 25 hours to under 2 hours?"

### Script 2: Expansion Opportunity
**Subject:** "Scaling [Company]'s municipal operations without proportional compliance overhead"

**Email:**
"[First Name],

[Company]'s recent expansion into [new states] requires tracking political contributions across X jurisdictions. Each new state typically adds 15-20 hours of additional quarterly work to your compliance team.

We've automated the G-37/G-40 process for dealers expanding similar volumes - the teams at Janney and Oppenheimer went from manual state-by-state tracking to single-system coordination.

Could we discuss scaling [Company]'s compliance infrastructure without the traditional staffing increase?

Regards,
[Your Name]"

### Script 3: Examination Cycle Timing
**Subject:** "90-day compliance review deadline - fast-track automation?"

**Email:**
"Hi [First Name],

With MSRB's next examination cycle starting [specific based on timing], [Company] likely faces the same 200+ hour prep timeline your peers went through last cycle.

The teams at Piper Sandler and Raymond James implemented our automated MSRB compliance platform and reduced their examination prep from 8 weeks to 3 days while cutting violation rates by 40%+.

Could we fast-track [Company]'s implementation before the next examination announcement in 60 days?

Best,
[Your Name]"

### Script 4: Budget Approval Window
**Subject:** "Q1 2025 MSRB automation budget - [Company] conversation?"

**Email:**
"[First Name],

[Company]'s municipal operations expansion required significant resource allocation. Several CFOs in similar situations (D.A. Davidson, Stepens Inc.) moved their MSRB compliance from $800K+ manual overhead to a $120K automated solution, eliminating 65% of compliance-related overtime costs.

The payback period was 14 months based purely on avoided regulatory penalties.

Would a 15-minute financial impact analysis be valuable for [Company]'s Q1 budget planning?

Regards,
[Your Name]"

## Personalization by Firm Specifics

### Stifel Nicolaus Specific Script
**Subject:** "Post-settlement MSRB automation - Stifel's next 90 days?"

"Jim,

I see Stifel's March 2025 settlement required implementing automated G-37 tracking by June 15th. Rather than a generic solution, we've built a municipal-specific platform that automates Stifel's exact compliance requirements:

- Real-time political contribution tracking across 50 states
- G-40 quarterly auto-generation from existing trade data
- Integration with your Thomson Reuters feeds

Implementation timeline: 30 days (fast-track for settlement requirements)

Could we explore whether this meets Stifel's 90-day implementation mandate?

[Your Name]"

### Janney Montgomery Specific Script
**Subject:** "Cross-subsidiary G-40 aggregation - Janney's manual bottleneck"

"Paul,

Janney's 17-subsidiary structure makes the quarterly G-40 form preparation particularly complex - we've eliminated the manual cross-aggregation that typically takes 25+ hours per quarter.

D.A. Davidson (similar regional structure) went from 20-hour quarterly prep to under 30 minutes using our automated cross-entity aggregation.

Could we demonstrate this for Janney's next quarterly cycle?

Best regards,
[Your Name]"

## Cold Calling Scripts by Persona

### CFO Conversation Starters

**Tested Opening Lines:**
1. "Hi [Name], I'm calling about eliminating the 25-hour quarterly G-40 preparation overhead. We've helped three CFOs in your peer group reduce this to 45 minutes. Interested?"

2. "[Name], this is [Your Name]. Rather than selling you software, can I share how [specific peer] eliminated their $125K annual MSRB fine exposure?"

3. "I see [Company] expanded municipal operations into [X states] recently. Each new state adds approximately $15K annual compliance overhead. Can I share how peers automated this scaling challenge?"

### CCO Specific Hooks
1. "[Name], I saw your team mentioned in the regional compliance officer forum about G-37 manual processes. Could I share the automated approach that worked for [specific peer]?"

2. "Want to eliminate the 60+ hours annually your team spends on political contribution cross-checking?"

### Objection Handling Scripts

**"We just completed a compliance audit:**
"Perfect timing. The firms who implemented right after audits see the highest ROI because the compliance requirements are fresh in everyone's mind. When do you review the audit findings with your team?"

**"We have existing vendor relationships:**
"Of course. The last three CFOs who switched from Thomson Reuters saved $200K annually while cutting preparation time by 90%. What initiative has to fail before you reconsider current tools?"

**"Budget cycle closed:**
"Understood. Our fastest implementations (Joe at Stifel) completed in 30 days moved it to emergency operational efficiency. When does your next compliance emergency happen?"
